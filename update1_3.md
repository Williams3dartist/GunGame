##Update 1.3

#Debug

*Went ahead and 3Dmodeled and textured and brought into Unity with proper Anchor Point.

*Studied gun parts and named them correctly.

*Realised I have more to do after watching videos of a Winchester rifle being shot and modeling each part. [Link to Winchester Rifle being shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHW_RC90BgM)

#Bugs

*Still cant seem to get the Bullet to fire. Wondering if I placed the script in the wrong area. Think I need to take a few steps back. Not sure what to do.

#To Fix

*Get the Instantiate to work.

*Study up on classes, objects, collections, Game State Machines, enums.

*See if model with textures and prefabs get Pushed correctly on Github.

#Deadline

*01-05-16 Get to studying classes, objects, collections, Game State Machines, enums.

*01-05-16 Try to load 10 rounds in gun. This Winchester Rifle actually takes 10 rounds.

*01-05-16 Get Lever to be pushed up before firing. This is a state where the bullet is pushed into the barrel before firing. I had to actually model this gun after all because it fires differently.
