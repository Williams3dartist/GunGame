WILLS COMMENT2
I think you are missing some notes exactly 3 lines above. Also I did what you said but error is still looking
for counter. I deleted both. Other error in Debug Log Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line
Error	CS1503	Argument 1: cannot convert from 'UnityEngine.KeyCode' to 'int'. Not sure.
